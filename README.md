MultiplicationGameGUI
=====================

My first GUI program in C#: a simple multiplication game.

The right label will pose a multiplication question.
Type the answer in the box, check the check mark, and press "Click me!"
Experience and levels will be gained.

This first started off as a simple "Hello, World!" program, hence the folder name.
Then I started adding more things.
